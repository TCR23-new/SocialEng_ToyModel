Details about the code organization
---------
The main function that you run is called mainFunct.py. This function will import from
DataGenerator.py 
TrainSocEngAgent.py

Currently no script imports from VisualizationFunctions.py. However, a jupyter notebook is included that was
used in the demo which provides examples of how functions from this script works.

Note: Given that it takes time to train, a series of data files from when I trained the models were included in
the folder.
